     <p>Berner (or Bernese in English) refers to the area of the breed's origin, in the canton of Bern. 
     This mountain dog was originally kept as a general farm dog. 
     Large Sennenhunde in the past were also used as draft animals, pulling carts. 
     The breed was officially established in 1907.
