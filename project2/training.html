     <p>Training a Bernese Mountain Dog takes time, commitment, and plenty of patience. 
     This breed is very large, so its very important to 
     give your dog proper training from puppyhood to make sure 
     he is a good canine citizen and a pleasure to be around. Before you even get your Bernese Mountain Dog, 
     you will want to make sure you have 
     the time to care for him and train him. 
     Your puppy or dog wants to please you, 
     so your job is to train him to understand you and your directions.
